GIT:  Git is a version control system (VCS) that is used for software development  and other version control tasks. As distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity,  and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git lives on your local machine and GitHub is up on the web.
	- Clone: pulls down files and saves them to your local machine.
	- Push: pushes files up to your GitHub cloud

How to save your files:
	- git add -A   Add all files to your local repository
	- git status   Shows the files that are in that add file.
	- git commit -m "comment of what changes have been made"   commits changes to the local repository
	- git push origin master:   pushes local changes to Github
