Responsive Web Design

our website should respond to the user's device. change the layout to accomodate small screens, different input methods, etc.

keyboard vs touch screen
network speed, and data limits


outdated practice: m.mysite.com
problems: sites might incorrectly guess what device you were on
cnn.com/section/some-specific-article -> m.cnn.com
having 2 sites doubles development effort, doubles chances for bugs.

when building a responsive site, we're mostly concerned with the width of the user's browser.


Desktop-first, graceful degradation
Mobile-first, progressive enhancement


relative units:
em : the size of a capital M in the current font. always relative to the immediate parent's font size, so it can be kind of a mess to use ems a lot.

much better to use rems (root ems)
