There are 3 different ways to create style sheets:

    External Style Sheet: 
        <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
        </head>

    Internal Style Sheet:
        <head>
            <style>
                body {
                    background-color: linen;
                }

                h1 {
                    color: maroon;
                    margin-left: 40px;
                } 
            </style>
        </head>

    Inline Style:
        <h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">This is a heading.</h1>

    Multiple Style Sheets
    If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 

    Inline style (inside an HTML element)
        External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
        Browser default
        So, an inline style (inside a specific HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the <head> tag, or in an external style sheet, or a browser default value.


User Agent Stylesheet is how the webpage is styling the page by default


Margin horizontally is like the sword analogy. If someone has a knofe that is 10 inches long and someone else has a sword that is 3 feet long and they just start walking towards each other. They won't stop with the 2 swords touch. But when the sword touches the other person. So the box will be 3 feet apart. NOT 3ft 10 inches.

Page Gravity analogy will fall to the top left corner of the page. elements that are position static are considered unpositioned elements.
