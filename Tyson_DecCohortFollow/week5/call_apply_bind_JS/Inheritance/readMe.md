# Inheritance
> Basically extending classes and making `subclasses`

## Relationships
`has a` relationships
- RESTAURANT has a MENU
- PLATE has some FOODITEMS

`is a` relationships
- DOG is a MAMMAL
- KING CHARLES CAVALIER is a DOG
- ARTIFICIER is a WIZARD
`is a` relationships are more appropriate for inheritance

## WHY
- Organization
- Write less code!

- Inheritance isn't used very often (especially in JS)
- Use it to save code
- Don't do it just for fun


class= 1// superclass
||
class= 2
||
class =3 // subclass


command click

attaching a method to a class you have to use prototype. Ex: Wizard.prototype.castSpell = function(){}
