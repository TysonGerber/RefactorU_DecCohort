<!-- Idea

be able to choose a time period. Let's say 2 years. based on the last 2 years. Is today's stock price a good time to buy?
Takes the low of the market and the high of the market and then it tells you if it is a good time to buy or sell. 

Example we have a graph that pulls up and shows 0 - 100% 50% is the average of the stock price over those 2 years. Our marker shows it is at 80% Then it will say it is a better time to sell. If at 40% it is a good time to sell.-->
